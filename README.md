* When the start screen opens you choose start to start and if you want to exit you move with the scroll button on the keyboard and select exit. (The level will be updated as soon as possible)

# How to play game

* You control the pacman character with the movement keys on the keyboard to avoid the ghosts and try to eat as many good ports.

* Each dot you eat you will get 1 point and if you eat the white dot, you can eat the ghost within 10 seconds (of course new ghosts will be born so be careful).

* If you eat all the points on the map without dying then congratulations, you have won. 

* On the contrary, if you hit the ghost during the move, you will be eaten by the ghost.
